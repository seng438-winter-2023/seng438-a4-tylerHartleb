# Introduction

In this lab, we will be running mutation tests suing PiTest on our test suites developed in the previous labs. After running mutation tests, we will improve our coverage, to remain consistent with the prior labs we will be using JUnit 4. We will also be designing test cases for [Amazon.ca](Amazon.ca) to run using Selenium.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

| Mutant                                           | Analysis                                                                                                                                                             | Killed? |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 333: Changed conditional boundary                | This mutant changed the conditional boundary of (lower < upper) in the Expand method. We can kill this mutant by adding additional boundary test cases.              | No      |
| 349: Replaced return value with null             | This mutant changes the return value of the shift function with a null value. This function should be killed by ensuring we are checking for null in our test cases. | No      |
| 365: Removed call to nullNotPermitted            | This mutant removes a call to the nullNotPermitted call in the shift function. This causes the function to not throw a result if a null value is passed in.          | No      |
| 391: Replaced double addition with subtraction   | This mutant replaces the addition call in the shiftWithNoZeroCrossing function. This mutant should be killed by testing with a negative value.                       | No      |
| 388: Replaced double return value with 0.0d      | This mutant replaces the return value in shiftWithNoZeroCrossing function with 0.0d. This mutant should be killed by testing with a positive value.                  | No      |
| 105: Replaced double return value with 0.0d      | This mutant replaces the return value in getLowerBound with zero.                                                                                                    | Yes     |
| 331: Replace double multiplication with division | This mutant replaces the multiplication in expand with division. This was killed as we tested equivalence classes.                                                   | Yes     |
| 90: Negated Conditional                          | This mutant negates the lower < upper conditional in the Range constructor. It                                                                                       | Yes     |
| 144: Replaced boolean return with False          | This mutant replaces the return value in contains with false. It will have been killed by any test that expects a true value.                                        | Yes     |
| 144: Replaced boolean return with True           | This mutant replaces the return value in contains with true. It will have been killed by any test that expects a false value.                                       | Yes     |

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

Original Coverage:

| Class         | Line Coverage | Mutation Coverage | Test Strength |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Range         | 66%           | 26%               | 40%           |
| DataUtilities | 51%           | 49%               | 100%          |

Updated Coverage:

| Class         | Line Coverage | Mutation Coverage | Test Strength |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Range         | 69%           | 47%               | 71%           |
| DataUtilities | 51%           | 49%               | 100%          |


# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

Our unit tests for DataUtilities was highly effective and killed every mutant that was covered by unit tests. There are mutations that were not covered by unit tests as we did not test all methods in the class. Our test cases for the Range class was not as effective and quite a few mutants covered by unit tests survived. Most of the surviving mutations were mutants that replaced a return value with a null or negated a conditional.

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants cause the mutation score to be lower than it should be, and leads us to believe that the test suite is inadequate. This is why it is important, if possible, to remove equivalent mutants from the mutants being used, as less equivalent mutants will increase the accuracy of the mutation score and make the mutation score a more accurate tool in assessing the strength of a given test suite. Detecting equivilent mutants is a difficult problem. Detecting manuelly is possible, but the time it takes to do so increase exponentially with the amount of test cases you have. There is research and some tools that can detect equivilent mutants automatically, but they will never catch all equivilent mutants in a test suite.

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

To improve the mutation score we can test more boundary cases. The majority of mutants missed in the Range class were boundary cases such as null, or conditional boundary changes. From these results it is important to be cognizant of boundaries when designing unit tests especially null values and the values around conditional changes. Additionally, some of our unit tests missed mutations as we did not properly check for a null value. By fixing these errors we were able to increase our mutation coverage without needing to add additional test cases.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Mutation testing is important because it helps ensure the quality of the test suite. It helps us make sure that our application is passing the tests because there is no error rather than due to poor quality of the tests. The advantages to mutation testing is that it can be automated, it is systematic and there is a clear target to aim for in mutation scores. It also allows for comparison of different test suites to determine which suite is better suited for the applications. Some challenges to mutation testing is the amount of resources it requires and the issue of equivalent mutations. There are also often too many mutants in an application for it to be feasible for manual equivalent mutant detection to be done, and automatic tools are very reasource intensive. 

# Explain your SELENIUM test case design process

To build SELENIUM test cases, we started by brainstorming what the most common functionalities of the website would be, and came up with the following 8 functions to test:
* Login
* Register
* Search
* Add to cart
* Create a list
* Add a shipping address
* Change country
* Edit cart items

Once we decided on the functions to test, we then came up with the following valid and invalid cases:

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

Assertions and checkpoints are used to verify that the expectations are met during the execution of a test on Selenium. The two methods both check for a certain condition, but the difference is that an assertion would quit the test process if the expected condition is not met, while checkpoints would continue and complete the test regardless of whether the expectation was satisfied but will give a report at the end.

# How did you test each functionaity with different test data?

First, we made a test scenario by recording the functionality test with valid, normal data. Then, we duplicated the test script and changed the values in appropriate sections, therefore automating the tests with different data.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Each member automated 1-3 test cases for each of the 8 functions using Selenium. For the mutation testing, we ran the Pitest together as a group and one member made the changes while the others documented the mutants and reported the results of the testing.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
    
We encountered some challenges during web testing. We encountered a bug in selenium where windows that opened through links would not be recognized. Alternatively, we were able to make use of the data-* attributes that Amazon had defined to extract the address it should be going to. Another challenge was the dynamic nature of the store page, which made testing the shopping cart difficult as products could become unavailable, or special offers would pop up preventing smooth navigation through the website. Moreover, we had to be creative when adding the verification due to the dynamic nature of the page. For example, when an item is searched with a keyword, we cannot guarantee that the same item will always show up in the results. Therefore, instead of verifying the resulting items, we designed verification points such that it will verify the existance of a certain element that will always appear in the result page, such as "<<keyword>>" element.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
The lab document was once again clear and easy to understand the tasks we needed to complete for this lab, but having a pdf version of it along with the markdown version would be helpful.
